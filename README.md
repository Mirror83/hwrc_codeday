HWCR - Human-Wildlife Conflict Resolution

This code is run from a local php server which is exposed to the internet using the ngrok tunneling service
The url provided by ngrok is what is used as the callback url in the Africa's Talking USSD platform..

The code also depends on a small database (for testing purposes) which is representative of a larger database that would be used in actual implementation by organizations like KWS(Kenya Wildlife Services) and KFS(Kenya Forest Service).
It consists of only one table that one can check the provided officer names against.
